        "* It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks given the vast compute and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and from the huge jumps in skill that they provide on related problems.\n",
        "* Transfer learning make use of `mthe knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem.\n",
